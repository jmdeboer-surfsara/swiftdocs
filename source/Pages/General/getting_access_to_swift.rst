If you are interested to use the SWIFT storage cluster, please contact the `SURFsara helpdesk`_ (helpdesk@surfsara.nl).



There are three ways to get access. 

- Local SWIFT account through the OpenStack Keystone AuthN service.
  This is what we recommend at the moment unless you have a special reason to use one of the other methods below.
- SWIFT account through the OpenStack keystone AuthN service using you user name and password that is in SURFsara Central User Administration (CUA) system. This is handy for users that use other SURFsara services like the national super computer or the Lisa compute cluster. 
- Local SWIFT account through swauth. This is for users that want to use the S3 API.
