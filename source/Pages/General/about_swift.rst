About SWIFT
***********

SWIFT is an all round online cloud storage system that is characterised by its scalability, durability and availability. SWIFT is ideal for storing unstructured data that can grow without bound. 

SWIFT is an object storage system which means that it does not have a directory-type structure like a normal file system has but it organises its data in so-called containers that contain objects.
