Library documentation
=====================

There are numerous libraries and bindings for OpenStack SWIFT. These are listed on: https://docs.openstack.org/developer/swift/associated_projects.html. 

The only one that is officially supported by OpenStack is the `Python-SwiftClient`_. So this is the only one we will discuss here.
The `Python-SwiftClient`_ has a `Service API`_ and a `Connection API`_.
