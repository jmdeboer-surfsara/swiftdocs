Cyberduck offers a GUI to connect to almost a gazillion different storage systems with equally many protocols to copy, put, get and delete files and folders. It can also be use to connect to Openstack SWIFT. Currently, we use Swiftstack which uses TempAuth for authentication which is a somewhat different way of authenticating than Openstack Keystone which is normally used. Cyberduck comes with a number of different profiles but the Swiftstack one is not one of them. The Swiftstack profile can be downloaded from: https://trac.cyberduck.io/wiki/help/en/howto/swiftstack. 

Cyberduck can be downloaded from https://cyberduck.io/. 
The video below shows you how to set things up.
